The evaluation config files are same for all the pretrained models. Please note, slightly different cost function may perform slightly better for different backbones.
The given config files allow you to run a quick search on the extracted representations. Otherwise, you can simply set `cost: 0.0001` in the config file which works reseaonably well for all the cases.
